Assignment Project

## Installation & usage

Install dv-project with Bower

```sh
$ bower i /dv-project --save
```

Import it into the `<head>` of your page

```html
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/dv-project/dv-project.html">
```

Then use dv-project in your project

```html
<dv-project></dv-project>
```

### Polyfills for cross-browser support

dv-project relies on emerging standards, for full cross-browser support include the [WebComponentsJS](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) polyfill on your page.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@^1.0.0/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
```

### Transpiling for IE11 support

Web Components like dv-project are distributed as ES6 classes, which are supported in all evergreen browsers. To support Internet Explorer 11 you should transpile dv-project to ES5 and use the `webcomponentsjs` `custom-elements-es5-adapter.js` shim. 

The easiest way to do this is by including [polymer-build][polymer-build] in your buildstep of choice. Then just include the ES5 adapter on your page

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@^1.0.0/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js"></script>
```
