# dv-project

Assignment Project

## Installation & usage

Install dv-project with Node and Bower
```
npm install
```
```
bower install
```

Run the local servers (Frontend + Backend)

1. Run Backend Server(server.js). (I have made minor modifications in this file to support CORS)
```
node server.js
```

2. Run Frontend Server
```
npm run demo
```

###NOTE
I have copied the server.js file from the original assignment and made few changes to support CORS
functionality in the server.
